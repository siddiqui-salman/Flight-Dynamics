Open loop simulation of F-104
Develop a closed-loop control simulation for your aircraft in MATLAB / Simulink to perform lateral waypoint navigation.  Your closed-loop control simulation will entail integrating the autopilots you designed for Deliverable 4, using linear models, into your full 6-DOF nonlinear aircraft simulation.  The nonlinear simulation should include actuator models (as discussed in the Deliverable 4 assignment) and also saturation limits.  Saturation limits represent the upper and lower limits on each control input and can be modeled using the Simulink Saturation block.  You can look up the control surface limits for your specific aircraft or use a default of +/- 30 degrees for rudder, aileron, and elevator.  The thrust control limits should be from 0 (engine off, zero thrust) to 1 (maximum thrust or power).
